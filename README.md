# Tic Tac Toe

This is my solution to the [Tic Tac Toe Project on The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/tic-tac-toe), using [Frontend Mentor's Tic Tac Toe game design](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/calculator-app-9lteq5N29).

- Class w/ TypeScript

### Continued development

- Optimal layout for mobile
- Add hover states to interactive elements
- Game state is saved in the browser
- Making computer's move smarter, or even [unbeatable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax)
- Allow players to put in their names and join the chatroom!

### Useful resources
